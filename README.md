## Psychology of Mobile User Interfaces with Flutter - 25 minutes of impromptu discussion and demonstrations.

This is the quick demo of different User Interface possibilities with Flutter - comparing and contrasting some iOS/Cupertino with some Material/Mountain-View alternatives.

What are the user interface elements that make people feel happy using iOS and/or Android - which "wrong" user interface components (e.g. dialog boxes, navigations, date pickers, etc.) would be "offputting" for ardent fans of a particular OS.  This includes a "bouncy" or "clamping" physics and animations in addition to fonts and colors.

Special thanks to Filip Hracek @filiph and his fun work simulating Windows 95 (https://github.com/filiph/win95_flutter ) interface in Flutter, to help illustrate the variety of options possible.
